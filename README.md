[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LyndonArmitage/sudoku.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LyndonArmitage/sudoku)

This is a simple implementation of a Sudoku solver in Java by Lyndon Armitage.

It requires Maven and Java 8 to build. 

It makes use of JUnit for Unit testing and sl4j for logging (the unit testing uses log4j, the main library leaves logging library choice up to the user).

## Current Features: ##

- Parsing Sudokus from file, stream and, strings
- Validating Sudokus
- Solving Sudokus with a simple logical approach

## Planned Features: ##
